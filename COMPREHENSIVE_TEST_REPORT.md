## 🛠️ Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Dashboard Routes Returning 404 
**Problem**: `/dashboard` and `/dashboard/image-generator` returned 404 errors  
**Root Cause**: Clerk middleware protecting routes but no ClerkProvider in demo mode  
**Solution**: Updated `middleware.ts` to skip authentication in demo mode  
**Result**: ✅ Both routes now accessible (Status 200)

```typescript
// Fixed middleware.ts
const isDemoMode = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE === 'true'
if (isDemoMode) {
  return // Skip authentication for all routes
}
```

### Issue 2: Payment API Returning 401 Unauthorized
**Problem**: Demo payment cards were being rejected with 401 status  
**Root Cause**: Payment API required authentication even in demo mode  
**Solution**: Updated `process-payment/route.ts` to handle demo mode properly  
**Result**: ✅ All demo cards now accepted (Visa, Mastercard, Amex)

```typescript
// Fixed payment API
const isDemoMode = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE === 'true';
if (!userId && !isDemoMode) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
}
```

### Issue 3: Dashboard Components Crashing with Clerk Errors
**Problem**: Components using `useUser` and `useClerk` causing 500 errors in demo mode  
**Root Cause**: No ClerkProvider wrapper causing hook failures  
**Solution**: Replaced direct Clerk hooks with `useSafeUser` hook  
**Result**: ✅ Dashboard loads properly with demo user data

```typescript
// Fixed nav-user.tsx and image-generator/page.tsx
import { useSafeUser } from '@/hooks/use-safe-user'
const { user } = useSafeUser() // Safe wrapper that works with/without Clerk
```

## 🔧 Technical Architecture Validated

### Authentication Flow ✅
- **Demo Mode**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` properly disables Clerk authentication
- **Safe User Hook**: `useSafeUser` provides consistent interface for both modes
- **Middleware**: Correctly bypasses protection for demo users
- **API Routes**: Handle both authenticated and demo users appropriately

### Payment System ✅ 
- **Demo Cards Working**: 4242424242424242 (Visa), 5555555555554444 (Mastercard), 378282246310005 (Amex)
- **Invalid Card Rejection**: 1234567890123456 properly rejected with Luhn validation
- **Luhn Algorithm**: Properly validates card numbers
- **Demo User Handling**: Creates `demo-user` entries instead of failing on null userId

### Image Generation ✅
- **Demo Mode**: Returns placeholder images from Unsplash for testing
- **API Response**: Proper structure with imageUrl and revisedPrompt
- **Rate Limiting**: Working with in-memory store
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema properly validates 3-800 character prompts
