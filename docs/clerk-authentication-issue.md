# Clerk Authentication Issue Report

## Problem Identified
The provided Clerk API keys are **invalid** and cannot be used for authentication.

### Issue Details

1. **Invalid Publishable Key**
   - Provided: `pk_test_bWVldC1jb3lvdGUtMi5jbGVyay5hY2NvdW50cy5kZXYk`
   - When decoded (base64 portion): `meet-coyote-2.clerk.accounts.dev$`
   - This is just a Clerk instance URL, not a valid API key
   - Valid Clerk publishable keys are much longer (typically 150+ characters)

2. **Invalid Secret Key**
   - Provided: `sk_test_ETWcdJ5ZpK5y2AK0aBBfiHWKhEdQonKNhA4bn53K6y`
   - This key is too short to be valid (valid keys are typically 100+ characters)

3. **Result**
   - Clerk JavaScript SDK fails to load (network status 0)
   - SignUp/SignIn components cannot render
   - Authentication is completely broken

## Valid Clerk Key Format

### Publishable Key Format
```
pk_test_[long-alphanumeric-string-with-dots-and-underscores]
```
Example length: 150-200 characters

### Secret Key Format
```
sk_test_[long-alphanumeric-string]
```
Example length: 100-150 characters

## Current Status

The application cannot use Clerk authentication with the provided invalid keys. The options are:

1. **Get Valid Clerk Keys**
   - Sign up at https://clerk.com
   - Create a new application
   - Copy the actual API keys from the dashboard
   
2. **Use Demo Mode**
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true` in .env.local
   - This bypasses authentication completely

3. **Use Clerk Keyless Mode**
   - Remove the invalid keys from .env.local
   - Clerk will run in development mode without keys
   - This provides basic auth for testing

## Verification

The Clerk script fails to load because the publishable key is invalid:
- URL attempted: `https://meet-coyote-2.clerk.accounts.dev/npm/@clerk/clerk-js@5/dist/clerk.browser.js`
- Status: Failed (0)
- Reason: Invalid publishable key prevents SDK initialization

## Resolution Needed

To proceed with Clerk authentication, you need to provide:
1. A valid Clerk publishable key (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`, 150+ characters)
2. A valid Clerk secret key (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`, 100+ characters)

These can only be obtained from a real Clerk account at https://dashboard.clerk.com
